* fix the stupid 'unlisted dependency' crap React keeps pulling with every time I use useEffect
  * turns out React is just whiny, it's actually fine & an acceptable practice
* GridPane padding on the right & ONLY THE RIGHT doesn't work on Safari, who the hell knows why
  * literally top, left & BOTTOM work PERFECTLY FINE, WHAT?!
* the animation is fucked when managed by a global grid state, figure out a way to break up that state into individual objects ASAP
  * for now we just did the workaround where we make the tile a smart component & manually pass its state change method to the parent
* Right click now works on tiles, but it also will place
