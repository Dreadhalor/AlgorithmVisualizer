* fix the stupid 'unlisted dependency' crap React keeps pulling with every time I use useEffect
  * turns out React is just whiny, it's actually fine & an acceptable practice
* GridPane padding on the right & ONLY THE RIGHT doesn't work on Safari, who the hell knows why
  * literally top, left & BOTTOM work PERFECTLY FINE, WHAT?!
* the animation is fucked when managed by a global grid state, figure out a way to break up that state into individual objects ASAP
  * for now we just did the workaround where we make the tile a smart component & manually pass its state change method to the parent
* transform: scale(0.9) fucks with the mouse detection & makes it flicker when on the border of a wall that's set to opacity any less than 1
  * opacity 1 is fine, 0.99 is fucked, anything else <1 is fucked
  * removing the border math also somehow works just fine
  * it's fixed when putting it into another nested container but then it fucks the animation
  * there is sub-pixel math going on because I can switch from one box to another without visibly moving the mouse
  * truly this is one of the largest conundrums I've ever had
  * I miss Angular so much
* the mouse detection is kinda fucked, all the border detection is offset to the left
* fix the drag-out-from-border detection, the current solution is janky as hell
